As I think about projects that could pique my interest this spring, I'm drawn to Adam
Smith's legacy in American culture and politics. My goal for the Spring 2023 semester is
to trace Smith's legacy through topic modelling *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* and *The
Wealth of Nations*, along with major academic papers and books that helped make Smith into
the icon of capitalism that he has become in American culture. After doing so, my aim is
to acquire Reddit data from subreddits such as r/wallstreetbets, r/antiwork, and others
that discuss capitalism and the economy. The goal in doing so is to examine how Smith's
legacy varies and whether modern day discussions of Smith are more closely related to
the contents of Smith's work or the works of economists from the Chicago school, such as
Milton Friedman.
