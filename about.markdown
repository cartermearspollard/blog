Hi, I'm Mears! I'm currently a graduate student in Virginia Tech's English
Department. My research focuses primarily on Southern literature and Digital Humanities.
In my free time, you'll find me desperately trying to learn more Python to keep up with
my research interests, listening to the news, reading about Behavioral Economics, or
going on hikes. In case it isn't obvious, I like to keep busy. There's so much to learn
and so little time to learn it all. So, here I am, doing my best to learn everything
possible. This website is a snippet of what I'm currently interested in.
